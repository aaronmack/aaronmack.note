* [1] The Ar (Asset Resolution) library **is** responsible for querying, reading, and writing asset data. 
* [2] It **provides** several interfaces **that** allow USD **to access** an asset without knowing how that asset is physically stored.
* [3] Ar **ships** with implementations based on a traditional filesystem.
* [4] However, users **can provide** custom implementations to integrate their own asset storage system
* [5] 1.For example, a user might **have** an asset system **that** stores assets in a database 2.and **uses** special identifiers to address those assets.
* [6] That user **could create** a custom implementation of the ArResolver interface that interprets those identifiers
* [7] This **would allow** the user to use those identifiers for references, payloads, and sublayer composition arcs and other places throughout USD.
* [8] Ar **does not** support custom resolvers implemented in Python to avoid performance issues, especially for multi-threaded consumers.
* [9] The primary resolver **is** the ArResolver subclass **that** Ar uses **to handle** all asset paths **that** are not **handled by** the other resolvers described below.
* [10] 1.ArResolver **is** the central interface **for** asset operations in Ar. 2.Clients **can implement** subclasses of this interface to customize behaviors for their asset system.
* [11] Ar **manages** a set **of** ArResolver subclasses **for** handling different asset paths,which are described below.
* [12] clients just **use** a single resolver that is accessed by calling ArGetResolver.
* [13] Ar **will determine** the appropriate subclass for handling the given input paths and forward the call to that subclass.
* [14] **To** create a custom primary resolver
* [15] 1.**Implement** an ArResolver subclass; 2.**Use** AR_DEFINE_RESOLVER to define the subclass as a resolver;
* [16] **Ensure** that the resolver plugin is located `where the plugin system can find it.`
* [17] at a minimum, the class **will** be constructed `during the first call to ArGetResolver.`
* [18] If no custom resolver is found, Ar **will** use ArDefaultResolver as the primary resolver.
* [19] This resolver **assumes** all asset paths it encounters are filesystem paths.
* [20] ArDefaultResolver also **performs** simple search path-based resolution that will search for an asset in a specified list of directories. 
* [21] **See** documentation on ArDefaultResolver for more information on configuring this behavior.
* [22] URI resolvers **are** ArResolver subclasses that are associated with particular URI schemes.
* [23] It **will** check if any ArResolver subclasses have been registered for the scheme

* [A1] a small object **used to** mark someone's place in some games played on boards
* [A2] **to react** to something with an opposing opinion or action, or to defend yourself against something:

* [B1] That's actually the same formula that we **are using** for cross products.
* [B2] ?The main plants that **are used** for biofuel production now are sugar cane
* [B3] Plans **are being redrawn**.
* [B4] Mean-square error of any estimation procedure **can be bounded** below by the Cramer-Rao lower bound
* [B5] ?But flexibility will prevail only if it **can be bound** by a firm disciplinary framework.
* [B6] At this point the meal **is eaten**.
* [B7] John **is eating** cornbread. 
* [B8] The key thing **is being interesting**
* [B9] It's just that **is been interesting**.

* [1A] The primary unit of scene description within a layer is a prim spec
* [2A] all of the prim spec objects specified in Sdf layers. 
* [3A] Other features abstracted at the layer level include undo/redo functionality and logging
* [4A] You should primarily work with scene description using the classes in the Usd library
* [5A] The UsdStage object not only represents a complete scene
* [6A] it also knows how each of the partial scene descriptions were combined to form the complete scene. 
* [7A] the UsdStage object has the context to know how the path of a UsdPrim object on the stage relates to the paths of each SdfPrimSpec object in each layer that contributes a partial description to the complete prim. 

* [1B] I feel like someone reached my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth, and tied it around my neck
* [2B] Looks like she didn't leave in such a hurry after all
* [3B] I think this is the episode of Three's Company......where's there's some kind of misunderstanding.


* [1C] At some stage of your graphics adventures you will want to draw text in OpenGL. 
* [2C] it is up to us to define a system for rendering text to the screen.
* [3C] but getting the relevant character(s) onto a texture could prove challenging
* [4C] This approach was quite popular back in the day (and still is) since it is fast and works on any platform
* [5C] but as of today more flexible approaches exist
* [6C] FreeType is a software development library that is able to load fonts
* [7C] What makes FreeType particularly attractive is that it is able to load TrueType fonts.
* [8C] the rasterized font images can be procedurally generated based on the preferred font height you'd like to obtain them in
* [9C] Be sure to link to freetype.lib and make sure your compiler knows where to find the header files.
* [10C] all we have to do is initialize the FreeType library and load the font as a face as FreeType likes to call it
* [11C] Next is an image from FreeType that shows all of the metrics it calculates for each character glyph
* [12C] offset we need to figure out the distance a glyph extends below the baseline
* [13C] While not an incredibly obvious effect, the image with ambient occlusion enabled does feel a lot more realistic due to these small occlusion-like details, giving the entire scene a greater feel of depth.

  1. [] - this means optional if without number, otherwise it means from

  4. < -e.g (A)<(ObC) Internal Contain，Adverbials contain object clauses
  5. (AtC) 定语从句 修饰名词和代词；定语是广义的形容词 (状语与定语的区分是看这个从句是形容什么还是增加信息量)
  6. (AdC) 状语从句 修饰动词，形容词，副词；给主句增加信息量；状语是广义的副词
  7. (PrC) 表语从句 表语是紧跟系动词之后的结构,我们称及物动词之后的结构为宾语，而称系动词之后的结构为表语
  8. (SuC) 主语从句 主语从句是在句子中充当主语的从句。　它与其它名词性从句一样，通常由连接代词或连接副词引导。
  9. (ObC) 宾语从句 作宾语的从句，放在动词或介词后面
  10. (Ad) 状语
      1. 状语是一种用来修饰动词，形容词，副词或全句的词，说明时间，地点，程度，方式等概念。

  12. (Pr) 表语 
      1. 表语是说明主语的身份、性质、品性、特征和状态的，表语位于系动词之后，与系动词联系十分紧密，有系动词就有表语，有表语就有系动词
      2. 分词作表语有两种情况： 一种是现在分词作表语，一种是过去分词作表语 e.g. interesting 使人感到有趣 - interested感到有趣的 exciting令人激动的- excited感到激动的 
      3. 形容词做表语
  13. (aux) 助动词，就是协助动词构成时态、语态的词。
  14. (phrase) - Noun Phrase - 名词短语 名词短语 = 限定词 + 修饰性成分/形容词短语 + 中心名词 e.g. A girl who is my sister. The book in the desk. A big apple
  15. (D-Obj) 双宾 谓语动词必须要跟两个宾语才能表达完整意思。两个宾语分别是动作的直接承受者（一般是物）和间接承受者（一般是人）e.g. give sb sth = give sth to sb. tell sb sth = tell sth to sb

* 副词不可以修饰动名词[1]
* 副词可以修饰动词,包括不定词、动名词和分词,通常位于被修饰的动词后面;修饰及物动词时,一般放在宾语的后面。[2]
  * e.g. 1. 副词修饰及物动词放在宾语后面 We may never **see** him **again**. 
  * e.g. 2. slowly修饰动名词walking。We saw a boat **coming** **quickly** toward us.
  * e.g. 3. They **walked** **slowly**. slowly修饰动词walked。
* 谓语动词不能直接做主语[3]
  * learning from your mistake is a good way to learn English.  -ing动词短语作主语就是一个普通的**陈述句**
  * Learn from your mistake is a good way to learn English.这个句子是不符合语法规定的的，因为祈使句又叫无主句
  * 如果把这个句子改为**祈使句**，应该是 Learn from your mistake. It/This is a good way to learn English.前一个句子多是表达一个事实，后一个句子就是建议
* 英语中可以没有主语[4]
  * 可以！**祈使句**！例如，Open the door！开门，open 为谓语动词，the door为宾语，此时，省略了主语，而这个句子依然是成立的！
* 祈使句的否定形式在前面加Don't[5]
  * e.g. Don’t go there alone！不要一个人去那里。
* 没有谓语从句，没有谓语从句这种说法，因为谓语从句不符合常规，没有动词可以用一个句子来修饰。[6]
