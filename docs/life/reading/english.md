  * DAVE: Really? Have you ever been to China?
  * JANE: Yes, I've been to China twice.
  * DAVE: What about India?
  * JANE: No, I haven't been to India. 
* When we talk about a period of time that continues from the past until now, we use the present perfect (have been I have traveLLed etc.). Here, Dave and jane are talking about the places janehas visited in her life, which is a period that continues until now. 
* `e.g. We've never had a car.`


### Present perfect continuous ( **I have been doing** )

---
* We use `for` + a period of time (two hours, six weeks etc.):

* We use `since` + the start of a period (8 o'clock, Monday, 1999 et c.):

### Past perfect ( **I had done** )
* Sarah went to a party last week. Paul went to the party too, but they didn't see each other. Paul left the party at 10.30 and Sarah arrived at 11 o'clock. 
* So: When Sarah arrived at the party, Paul wasn't there.He had gone home.Had gone is the past perfect (simple): 
* The past perfect simple is had + past participle (gone/ seen/ finished etc) 
* Some more examples: 
  * `When we got home last night, we found that somebody had broken into the flat.`
  * Karen didn't want to go to the cinema with us because she'd already seen the movie.

### **Used to (do)**
* Something used to happen = it happened often in the past, but no longer happens
  * `I used to play tennis a lot, but I don't play very much now`
* We also use used to ... for things that were true, but are not true any more
  * This building is now a furniture shop. It used to be a cinema. 

## (19~25) Future

### Present tenses( **I am doing/I do** ) for the future
* Present continuous {I am doing) with a future meaning 
  * This is Ben's diary for next week.
  * He is playing tennis on Monday afternoon. 
  * He is going to the dentist on Tuesday morning. 
  * `He is having dinner with Kate on Friday.`
  * In all these examples, Ben has already decided and arranged to do these things.

### Present simple ( **I do** ) with a future meaning 
* We use the present simple when we talk about timetables, programmes etc. (for public transport, cinemas etc.): 
  * `My train leaves at 11.30, so I need to be at the station by 11.15`

### **(I'm) going to (do)**
* I am going to do something= I have already decided to do it, I intend to do it: 
  * `e.g. Are you going to eat anything?' I No, I'm not hungry.'`

### **Will/shall**
* We use I'll(= I will) when we've just decided to do something. When we say 'I'll do something'
  * We often use I think I'Ll ... and I don't think I'll ... :
    * `e.g. I feel a bit hungry. I think I'll have something to eat. `
---
* We do not use will to say what somebody has already arranged or decided to do:
  * `e.g. Diane is working next week. (not Diane will work)  `
* But often, when we talk about the future, we are not talking about what somebody has decided to do. For example: 
  * Kate is doing an exam next week. Chris and joe are talking about it
    * A: Do you think Kate will pass the exam?
    * B: Yesy, she'll pass easlly
  * She'll pass does not mean 'she has decided to pass'. Joe is saying what he knows or believes will happen. He is predicting the future. When we predict a future happening or situation, we use `will/won't`.
* `e.g. They've been away a long time. When they return, they'll find a lot of changes here.`

### **I will** and **I'm going to**

* Study the difference between will and (be) going to:

</div>

### **will be doing** and **will have done**
* In the cinema
  * now
    * These people are standing in a queue to get into the cinema.

---
* I will be doing something (future continuous) = I will be in the middle of doing it
  * `e.g. This time next week I'll be on holiday. I'll be lying on the beach or swimming in the sea. `

### **When I do** / **When I've done** **When** and **if**
* e.g.
  * A:Will you phone me tomorrow? 
  * B:Yes, I'll phone you when I get home from work
  * 'I'll phone you when I get home' is a sentence with two parts: the main part: I'll phone you and the when-part: when I get home The time in the sentence is future (tomorrow), but we use a present tense (I get) in the when-part of the sentence. We do not use will in the when-part of the sentence
* `e.g. We'll go out when it stops raining. (not when it will stop) `

## (26~37) Modals

### **Can, could** and **(be) able to**
* We use can to say that something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do something. We use can+ infinitive (can do / I can see etc.): 
  * `e.g. We can see the lake from our hotel. `
* The negative is can't(=cannot)
  * `e.g. I'm afraid I can't come to the party on Friday. `
* You can say that somebody is able to do something, but can is more usual:
  * `e.g. We are able to see the lake from our hotel. ` 
* But can has only two forms: can (present) and could (past). So sometimes it is necessary to use (be) able to. Compare:
  * I can't sleep. | I haven't been able to sleep recently. 
  * Tom can come tomorrow | Tom might be able to come tomorrow. 

### **Could (do)** and **could have(done)**
* We use could in a number of ways. Sometimes could is the past of can
  * `Listen. I can hear something. (now)`
  * `I listened. I could hear something. (past) `
* But could is not only used in this way. We also use could to talk about possible actions now or in the future (especially to make suggestions).
  * e.g. 1
    * `A: What shall we do tonight?`
    * `B: We could go to the cinema. `
  * e.g. 2
    * `A: When you go to Paris next month, you could stay with Sarah.`
    * `B: Yes, I suppose I could. `

---

* We use could have (done) to talk about the past. Compare:
  * `The situation is bad, but it could be worse. (now)`
  * `The situation was bad, but it could have been worse. (past)`

### **Must** and **can't**
* e.g.
  * `My house is very near the motorway. It must be very noisy.`
* You can use must to say that you believe something is certain
  * You've been travelling all day. You must be tired. (Travelling is tiring and you've been travelling all day, so you must be tired.) 
* You can use can't to say that you believe something is not possible
  * `You've just had lunch. You can't be hungry already.` (People are not normally hungry just after eating a meal. You've just eaten, so you can't be hungry.) 

### **May** and **Might**
* You are looking for Ben. Nobody is sure where he is/ but you get some suggestions. 
  * `He may be in his office. (=perhaps he is in his office)`
  * `He might be having lunch. (=perhaps he is having lunch)`
  * Ask Ann. She might know (=perhaps she knows)
* Usually you can use may or might
  * It may be true. or It might be true. (= perhaps it is true) 
---
* We use may and might to talk about possible actions or happenings in the future:
  * e.g. I haven't decided yet where to go on holiday. I may go to Ireland. (=perhaps I will go there) 
* Compare will and may/might:
  * I'll be late this evening. (for sure)
  * I may/might be late this evening. (possible) 

### **Have to** and **Must**
* I have to do something = it is necessary to do it, I am obliged to do it
  * `e.g. You can't turn right here. You have to turn left`
* We use do/does/did in questions and negative sentences (for the present and past simple):
  * What do I have to do to get a new driving licence?
* You can say I'll have to ... , I'm going to have to ... and I might / I may have to ... :
  * e.g. They can't fix my computer, so I'll have to buy a new one.

### **Must** **mustn't** **needn't**
* Must and mustn't
  * Don't tell anybody what I said. You `must` keep it a secret
  * You must keep it a secret. You `mustn't` tell anyone
* Needn't and don't need to
  * `We've got plenty of time. We needn't hurry`
  * We don't need to hurry.
* NOTICE
  * Remember that we say don't need to do I doesn't need to do, but needn't do (without to)
* Needn't have (done) 
  * `( A man that call to restaurant for reserve a table )` Hello, can I reserve a table for two, please? ( `when he got there, he found a lot of empty seats` ) We needn't have reserved a table. 
* Compare needn't (do) and needn't have (done):
  * Everything will be OK. You needn't worry. (it is not necessary)
  * Everything was OK. You needn't have worried. (you worried, but it was not necessary) 

### **Should**
* You should do something= it is a good thing to do or the right thing to do. You can use should to give advice or to give an opinion: 
  * You look tired. You should go to bed. 
  * The government should do more to improve education
  * `Should we invite Stephanie to the party? Yes, I think we should. `
* You can use should when something is not right or what you expect : 
  * Where's Tina? She should be here by now 
* You should have done something = you didn't do it, but it would have been the right thing to do: I wonder why they're so late. They should have got here long ago 
* Ought to ...You can use ought to instead of should in the sentences on this page. We say 'ought to do' (with to): 
  * Do you think I ought to apply for this job? (= Do you think I should apply ... ?) 
  * Jack ought not to go to bed so late. (= Jack shouldn't go ... ) 
  * It was a great party last night. You ought to have come.
  * Helen has been studying hard for the exam, so she ought to pass.
* You can use should after: 
  * insist recommend suggest demand propose
  * e.g.
    * `I insisted that he should apologies`
    * Doctors recommend that everyone should eat plenty of fruit.
* You can also begin with should (Should something happen ... ):
  * e.g. Should the situation change, we will contact you.
  * This means the same as 'If the situation changes, ... '. With should, the speaker feels that the possibility is smaller. 

## **Had better** **It's time**

### **Had better (I'd better I you'd better etc.)**

* I'd better do something = it is advisable to do it. If I don't do it, there will be a problem or a danger: 
  * `I have to meet Amy in ten minutes. I'd better go now or I'll be late.`
  * Shall I take an umbrella?' 'Yes, you'd better. It might rain.
  * We'd better stop for petrol soon. The tank is almost empty. 
---
* The negative is I'd better not(= I had better not):
  * The jacket looks good on you. Are you going to buy it?' 'I'd better not. It's too expensive.
  * `You don't look very well. You'd better not go out tonight. `

### **Remember that:**
* The form is 'had better' (usually 'I'd better / you'd better' etc. in spoken English).
  * I'd better phone Chris, hadn't I? 
* Had is normally past, but the meaning of had better is present or future, not past.
  * I'd better go to the bank now I tomorrow.
* We say 'I'd better do' (not to do):
  * `It might rain. We'd better take an umbrella. (not We'd better to take) `
---
* Had better and should
* Had better is similar to should, but not exactly the same. We use had better only for a specific situation, not for things in general. You can use should in all types of situations to give an opinion or give advice:
  * It's late. You'd better go. I You should go. (a specific situation)
  * You're always at home. You should go out more often. (in general - not 'had better go')
* Also, with had better, there is always a danger or a problem if you don't follow the advice.
---
* Should means only 'it is a good thing to do'. Compare:
  * It's a great film. You should go and see it. (but no problem if you don't)
  * The film starts at 8.30. You'd better go now or you'll be late. 

### **It's time ...**

* You can say It's time (for somebody) to ... :
  * `It's time to go home. / It's time for us to go home. `

### **Would**
* We use would ('d) / wouldn't when we imagine a situation or action (= we think of something that is
not real):
  * `It would be nice to buy a new car, but we can't afford it. `
* We use would have (done) when we imagine situations or actions in the past (=things that didn't happen)
  * I didn't tell Sam what happened. He wouldn't have been pleased. 
* Compare would (do) and would have (done): 
  * I would call Lisa, but I don't have her number. (now)
  * I would have called Lisa, but I didn't have her number. (past) 

### **Can/Could/Would you...?** etc (Requests, offers, permission and invitations)
* Asking people to do things (requests)
  * We use can or could to ask people to do things:
  * e.g. Can you wait a moment, please? Can you do me a favour?
* Note that we say Do you think you could ... ? (not can):
  * Do you think you could take me to the station?
* Asking for things
  * To ask for something, we use `Can I have ... ?` / `Could I have ... ?` or `Can I get ... ?`:
    * Can I have these postcards, please? or Can I get these postcards, please?
  * May I have ... ? is also possible:
    * e.g. May I have these postcards, please?

## (38~41) If and wish 

### **If I do** ... and **If I did** ... 
* e.g. Shall we go by bus or by train? If we go by bus, it will be cheaper
* `When we imagine something that will not happen, or we don't expect that it will happen`, we use if + past (if we went / if there was / if you found etc.).

### **If I knew** ... **I wish I knew**
* When we imagine a situation like this, we use if + past (if I knew / if you were / if we didn't etc.). But the meaning is present, not past
* e.g.
  * There are many things I'd like to do if I had more time. (but I don't have time)
  * `If I didn't want to go to the party, I wouldn't go. (but I want to go)`
  * We wouldn't have any money if we didn't work. (but we work)
* We use the past in the same way after wish (I wish I knew / I wish you were etc.). We use wish to say that we regret something, that something is not as we would like it to be
* e.g.
  * `I wish I knew Paul's phone number.(= I don't know it and I regret this)`
  * Do you ever wish you could fly? (you can't fly)
  * It rains a lot here. I wish it didn't rain so much.

### **If I had known**... **I wish I had known**...

* Study this example situation:
  * Last month Gary was in hospital for a few days. Rachel didn't know this ~ so she didn't go to visit him. They met a few days ago.
  * Rachel said:
    * `If I'd known you were in hospital, I would have gone to see you.`
  * Rachel said: 
    * If I'd known (=If I had known) you were in hospital. This tells us that she didn't know. 
* We use if + had ('d) ... to talk about the past (if I had known/ been/done etc.):
  * I didn't see you when you passed me in the street. If I'd seen you, of course I would have said hello. (but I didn't see you) 

---
* Compare:
  * I'm glad I saw him. (= I saw him)
  * `I wish I’d seen him. (= I didn’t see him)`

### **Wish**
You can say 'I wish you Luck / all the best / a happy birthday' etc.:
  * `I wish you all the best in the future.`
  * I saw Mark before the exam and he wished me Luck.
---
* We say 'wish somebody something' (Luck / a happy birthday etc.). But you cannot say 'I wish that something happens'. We use hope in this situation. For example:
  * I'm sorry you're not well. I hope you feel better soon. (not I wish you feel)
---
Compare I wish and I hope:
  * I wish you a pleasant stay here.
  * I hope you have a pleasant stay here. (not I wish you have)

## (42~46) Passive 

### Passive 1 (**is done** / **was done**) 
* Study this example: 
  * This house was built in 1961, Was built is passive. Compare active and passive: Somebody built this house in 1961. (active) This house was built in 1961 . (passive) 
* When we use an active verb, we say what the subject does: 
  * My grandfather was a builder. He built this house in 1961.
* When we use a passive verb, we say what happens to the subject: 
  * 'How old is this house?' 'It was built in 1961.'
* When we use the passive, who or what causes the action is often unknown or unimportant
  * `A lot of money was stolen in the robbery. (somebody stole it, but we don't know who)`
* If we want to say who does or what causes the action, we use by: 
  *  This house was built by my grandfather

<div align=center>

</div>

### Passive 2 (**be done** **been done** **being done**)
* Study the following active and passive forms
  * Infinitive
    * `active (to) do/clean/see et c. Somebody will clean this room later.`
    * `passive (to) be + done/cleaned/seen etc. This room will be cleaned later.`
    * e.g.
      * The situation is serious. Something must be done before it's too late.
      * A mystery is something that can't be explained.
      * The music was very loud and could be heard from a long way away.
      * A new supermarket is going to be built next year.
      * Please go away. I want to be left alone

<div align=center>
<img src="../_images/life/english_grammar_passive2.jpg" width="400">
</div>

### **It's said that**... **He is said to**... **He is supported to**...
* Study this example situation
  * George is very old. Nobody knows exactly how old he is, but:
    * `It is said that he is 108 years old.`
    * or `He is said to be 108 years old.`
  * Both these sentences mean: 'People say that he is 108 years old.' 

### **Have something done**
* Study this example situation
  * The roof of Lisa's house was damaged in a storm. So she called a builder, and yesterday a man came and repaired it. `Lisa had the roof repaired yesterday.` This means: Lisa arranged for somebody else to repair the roof. She didn't repair it herself
* We use have something done to say that we arrange for somebody else to do something for us.
  * Compare:
    * Lisa repaired the roof. (=she repaired it herself)
    * Lisa had the roof repaired. (=she arranged for somebody else to repair it)
    * Did you make those curtains yourself? Yes, I enjoy making things.
    * Did you have those curtains made? No, I made them myself.

## (47~48) Reported speech 

### Reported speech 1 (**He said that** ...) 
* Study this example situation:
  * You want to tell somebody what Paul said. There are two ways of doing this: 
    * You can repeat Paul's words (direct speech): `Paul said 'I'm feeling ill.'`
    * Or you can use reported speech: `Paul said that he was feeling ill.`
* When we use reported speech, the main verb of the sentence is usually past (Paul said that ... / I told her that ... etc.). The rest of the sentence is usually past too:
  * Paul said that he was feeling ill.
  * I told Lisa that I didn't have any money
* You can leave out that. So you can say:
  * Paul said that he was feeling ill. or Paul said he was feeling ill.
* In general, the present form in direct speech changes to the past form in reported speech:
  * am/is --- was   do/does --- did     will --- would
  * are --- were    have/has --- had    can --- could
  * want/like/know/go etc. --- wanted/Liked/knew/went etc.

### Reported speech 2
* It is not always necessary to change the verb in reported speech. If the situation is still the same, you do not need to change the verb to the past.   For example:
  * direct 
    * `Paul said 'My new job is boring.'`
  * reported 
    * `Paul said that his new job is boring.`
  * (The situation is still the same. His job is still boring now.)
  * direct 
    * Helen said 'I want to go to Canada next year.'
  * reported
    * Helen told me that she wants to go to Canada next year.
  * (Helen still wants to go to Canada next year.)

## (49~52) Questions and auxiliary verbs  

### Questions 1 
* In questions we usually put the subject after the first verb:
  * subject + verb   ---> verb + subject
  * Tom will ---> will Tom?  Will Tom be here tomorrow?
  * You have ---> Have you?  Have you been working hard?
  * The house was ---> was the house? When was the house built?
* Remember that the subject comes after the first verb
  * Is Katherine working today? (not Is working Katherine)
---
* In present simple questions, we use do/does:
  * you live ~ do you Live?  Do you Live near here?
  * the film starts ~ does the film start? What time does the film start?
* In past simple questions, we use did:
  * you sold ~ did you sell?  Did you sell your car?
  * the train stopped ~ did the train stop?  Why did the train stop?
---
* Note the position of prepositions in questions beginning Who/What/Which/Where ... ?:
  * Who do you want to speak to?  What was the weather Like yesterday?
  * Which job has Tina applied for?  Where are you from?
* You can use preposition + whom in formal style:
  * To whom do you wish to speak?
---
* Isn't it ... ? I Didn't you ... ? etc. (negative questions)
---
* We use negative questions especially to show surprise:
  * Didn't you hear the doorbell?  rang it three times.
---
* or when we expect the listener to agree with us:
  * Haven't we met before?' Yes, I think we have.'
---
* Note the meaning of yes and no in answers to negative questions:
  * Don't you want to go. (Yes, I want to go | No, I don't want to go)
---
* Note the word order in negative questions beginning Why .. . ?:
  * Why don't we eat out tonight? (not Why we don't eat)
  * Why wasn't Emma at work yesterday? (not Why Emma wasn't)

### Questions 2 (**Do you know where**...? / **He asked me where**...)
* Do you know where ... ? / I don't know why ... / Could you tell me what ... ? etc
  * We say: Where has Tom gone?
  * but Do you know where Tom has gone? (not Do you know where has Tom gone?)
---
* When the question (Where has Tom gone?) is part of a longer sentence (Do you know ... ? / I don't know ... / Can you tell me .. . ? etc.), the word order changes. We say:
  * What time is it?  Do you know what time it is?
  * Who are those people?  I don't know who those people are.
  * Where can I find Louise? Can you tell me where I can find Louise?
  * How much will it cost? Do you have any idea how much it will cost?
---
* Be careful with do/does/did questions. We say:
  * What time does the film start?  Do you know what time the film starts? (not does the film start)
  * What do you mean? Please explain what you mean.
  * Why did she Leave early? I wonder why she Left early
---
* Use if or whether where there is no other question word (what, why etc.):

### Auxiliary verbs (**have/do/can** etc. **I think so / I hope so** etc.)

  * I `have` $lost$ my keys.
  * She `can't` $come$ to the party.
  * The hotel `was` $built$ ten years ago.
  * Where `do` you $live$?
  * In these examples `have/can't/was/do` are auxiliary (=helping) verbs.

  * It was a good film, wasn't it? Yes, It was great.
* Have you? and wasn't it? are question tags(= mini-questions that we often put on the end of a sentence in spoken English). In question tags, we use an auxiliary verb (`have/was/will` etc.). We use `do/does/did` for the present and past simple
  * Karen plays the piano, doesn't she? Well, yes, but not very well.
  * You didn't lock the door, did you? No, I forgot.

  * If try (with this meaning) is followed by a verb, we say try -ing:

  * So you can say:

  * For example:
    *  Paul lives in Berlin now. He Likes Living there. (He Likes Living in Berlin= He lives there and he likes it)
* (2) There is sometimes a difference between I Like to do and I Like doing:
  * I Like doing something = I do it and I enjoy it:
    * I Like cleaning the kitchen. (= I enjoy it.)
  * I Like to do something = I think it is a good thing to do, but I don't necessarily enjoy it:

| I prefer  | doing something     | to doing something else.  |

  * I prefer this coat to the coat you were wearing yesterday.
  * I prefer driving to travelling by train.
  * I prefer to drive rather than travel by train.
  * Sarah prefers to Live in the country rather than (Live) in a city.
---
* Would prefer (I'd prefer ... )
  * We use would prefer to say what somebody wants in a specific situation (not in general)
    * 'Would you prefer tea or coffee?' 'Coffee, please.'
  * We say 'would prefer to do something' (not usually would prefer doing):
    * 'Shall we go by train?' 'I'd prefer to drive.' (not I'd prefer driving)
* Would rather (I'd rather ...)
  * Would rather (do) = would prefer (to do). We use would rather + infinitive {without to).

    * 'Would you rather have tea or coffee?' 'Coffee, please.
---
* I'd rather somebody did something

    * 'Jack says he'll repair your bike tomorrow, OK?' 'I'd rather he did it today.

### Preposition (**in/for/about** etc.) + **-ing**
* If a preposition (in/for/about etc.) is followed by a verb, the verb ends in -ing:

| | preposition | verb (-ing) | |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Are you interested|  in  | working | for us?|
| I'm not good|  at  | Learning | languages.|
| Sue must be fed up|  with  | studying||
| What are the advantages|  of  | having|  a car?|
| Thanks very much|  for  | inviting|  me to your party.|
| How| about |  meeting | for lunch tomorrow?|
| Why don't you go out|  instead of  | sitting | at home all the time?|
| Amy went to work|  in spite of |  feeling | ill.|
* You can also say 'instead of somebody doing something', 'fed up with people doing something' etc. :

* Note the use of the following prepositions + -ing:
  * before -ing and after -ing:

    * The burglars got into the house by breaking a window and climbing in.
    * You can improve your English by reading more.

    * We ran ten kilometres without stopping
---
* To -ing (look forward to doing something etc.)
* To is often part of the infinitive (to do I to see etc.):
  * We decided to travel by train.

### **Be/get used to** something (**I'm used to ...**)
* Study this example situation:
  * Lisa is American, but she lives in Britain. When she first drove a car in Britain, she found it very difficult because she had to drive on the left, not on the right. Driving on the left was strange and difficult for her because:
  * She wasn't used to it.
  * She wasn't used to driving on the left.
  * But after a lot of practice, driving on t he left became less strange. So:
  * She got used to driving on the left.
  * Now ifs no problem for Lisa:
  * She is used to driving on the left.
---
* I'm used to something = it is not new or strange for me:
  * Paul lives alone. He doesn't mind this because he has lived alone for 15 years. It is not strange for him. He is used to it. He is used to Living alone.
  * I bought some new shoes. They felt a bit strange at first because I wasn't used to them
---
* After be/get used you cannot use the infinitive (to do / to drive etc.). We say:
  * She is used to driving on the left. (not She is used to drive)
* When we say 'I am used to something', to is a preposition, not a part of the infinitive.
  * So we say:
    * We're not used to the noise. / We're not used to it
---
* Do not confuse I am used to doing and I used to do:
  * I am used to (doing) something = it isn't strange or new for me:
    * I am used to the weather in this country.
  * I used to do something= I did it regularly in the past but no longer do it. You can use this only for the past, not for the present
    * The structure is 'I used to do' (not I am used to do):
      * I used to drive to work every day, but these days I usually go by bike.

### Verb + preposition + **-ing** (**succeed in -ing/ accuse** somebody ** of -ing** etc.)
* Many verbs have the structure verb + preposition (in/for/about etc.) + object
* For example:
|verb+|preposition|+object|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|We talked|about|the problem|
|You must apologise| for |what you said|
* If the object is another verb, it ends in -ing
|verb+|preposition|+object|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|We talked|about|going to South America|
|You must apologise| for |not telling the truth|
* You can also say 'approve of somebody doing something', 'look forward to somebody doing something' etc :
  * I don't approve of people killing animals for fun.
  * We are all looking forward to Andy coming home
---
* The following verbs can have the structure verb + object + preposition + -ing:

  * We do not use afraid of -ing for things we do intentionally:

  * When we were on holiday, we stayed at a hotel. Sometimes we ate at the hotel and sometimes we went to a restaurant.

* The young = young people, the rich = rich people etc. :
  * Do you think the rich should pay higher taxes?
* The young / the rich / the injured etc. are plural in meaning. For example, you cannot say 'a young' or 'the injured' for one person. You must say 'a young person', 'the injured woman' etc.

* With these words (Italians etc.), we do not normally use the to ta lk a bout the people in general

### Names with and without **the** 1

### Names with and without **the** 2

  * hotels - the Sheraton Hotel, the Holiday Inn
---
* Names with of usually have the. For example:

### Singular and plural
* Sometimes we use a plural noun for one thing that has two parts. For example:
  * trousers (two legs) also jeans,tights,shorts,pants / pyjamas (top and bottom) / glasses / binoculars / scissors
* These words are plural, so they take a plural verb:
  * My trousers are too long. (not my trousers is)
* You can also use a pair of + these words:
  * Those are nice jeans. or That's a nice pair of jeans. (not a nice jeans)

### Noun + noun (a **tennis ball** / a **headache**)
* You can use two nouns together (noun+ noun) to mean one thing/person/idea etc. For example:
  * a tennis ball / income tax / the city centre
* The first noun is like an adjective. It tells us what kind of thing/person/idea etc. For example:
  * a tennis ball = a ball used to play tennis
  * a bus driver = the driver of a bus
* Compare:
  * garden vegetables (=vegetables that are grown in a garden)

* In the same way we say:
  * a three-hour journey (= a journey that takes three hours)

### **-'s** (**your sister's** name) and **of ...** (the name ** of the book**)
* We use-'s (apostrophe + s) mostly for people or animals:
  * Tom's computer isn't working. (not the computer of Tom)
* You can use-'s without a noun after it:
  * This isn't my book. It's my sister's. (=my sister's book)
* We use-'s with a noun (Tom/friend/teacher etc.). We do not use-'s with a long group of words.
* So we say:

* but the name of the woman sitting by the door
* Note that we say a woman's hat(= a hat for a woman), a boy's name (=a name for a boy), a bird's egg(= an egg laid by a bird) etc
---
* With a singular noun we use -'s:
  * my sister's room (=her room - one sister) Mr Carter's house(= his house)
* With a plural noun (sisters, friends etc.) we put an apostrophe (') at the end of the word:
  * my sisters' room (= their room - two or more sisters)
---
* For things, ideas etc., we normally use of (... of the water / ... of the book etc.):
  * the temperature of the water (not the water's temperature)
* Sometimes the structure noun + noun is possible:
  * the water temperature / the restaurant owner
* We say the beginning/end/middle of ... / the top/bottom of ... / the front/back/side of ...:
  * the beginning of the month (not the month's beginning)

## (92~97) Relative clauses

### Relative clauses 1: clauses with **who/that/which**
* Look at this example sentence

<div align=center>
<img src="../_images/life/english_relative_clauses_example1.jpg" width="400">
</div>

* A clause is a part of a sentence. A relative clause tells us which person or thing (or what kind of person or thing) the speaker means:
  * The woman who Lives next door ... ('who lives next door' tells us which woman)
  * People who live in the country ... ('who live in the country' tells us what kind of people)
* We use who in a relative clause when we are talking about people (not things):

<div align=center>
<img src="../_images/life/english_relative_clauses_example2.jpg" width="400">
</div>

* e.g.
  * An architect is someone who designs buildings.
  * What was the name of the person who phoned?
  * Anyone who wants to apply for the job must do so by Friday
* You can also use that (instead of who), but you can't use which for people:
  * The woman that Lives next door is a doctor. (not the woman which)
* Sometimes you must use who (not that) for people. See [Extra information 1](#releative-clauses-4-extra-information-clauses-1)
---
* When we are talking about things, we use that or which (not who) in a relative clause:

<div align=center>
<img src="../_images/life/english_relative_clauses_example3.jpg" width="400">
</div>

* e.g.
  * I don't like stories that have unhappy endings. (or stories which have ... )
  * Grace works for a company that makes furniture. (or a company which makes furniture)
  * The machine that broke down is working again now. (or The machine which broke down)

* That is more usual than which, but sometimes you must use which. See [Extra information 1](#releative-clauses-4-extra-information-clauses-1)
---
* Remember that in relative clauses we use who/that/which, not he/she/they/it.
* Compare:
  * 'Who's that woman ?' 'She lives next door to me.'
  * I've never spoken to the woman who lives next door. (not the woman she lives)
  * Where is the cheese? lt was in the fridge.
  * Where is the cheese that was in the fridge? (not the cheese it was)

### Relative clauses 2: clauses with and without **who/that/which**

* Look at these example sentences

<div align=center>
<img src="../_images/life/english_relative_clauses_example4.jpg" width="400">
</div>

* You must use who/that/which when it is the subject of the relative clause. So you cannot say 'The woman lives next door is a doctor' or 'Where is the cheese was in the fridge?'.
---
* Sometimes who/that/which is the object of the verb. For example:

<div align=center>
<img src="../_images/life/english_relative_clauses_example5.jpg" width="400">
</div>

* When who/that/which is the object, you can leave it out. So you can say:
  * The woman I wanted to see was away. or The woman who I wanted to see ...
  * Have you found the keys you Lost? or ... the keys that you lost?
  * The dress Lisa bought doesn't fit her very well. or The dress that Lisa bought ...
  * Is there anything I can do? or ... anything that I can do?
* Note that we say:
  * the keys you Lost (not the keys you lost them)
  * the dress Lisa bought (not the dress Lisa bought it)
---
* Note the position of prepositions (in/to/for etc.) in relative clauses:

<div align=center>
<img src="../_images/life/english_relative_clauses_example6.jpg" width="400">
</div>

---
* You cannot use what in sentences like these
  * Everything (that) they said was true. (not Everything what they said)
  * I gave her all the money (that) I had. (not all the money what I had)
* What = the thing(s) that:
  * Did you hear what they said? (= the things that they said)

### Relative clauses 3: **Whose/whom/where**
* Whose

<div align=center>
<img src="../_images/life/english_relative_clauses_example7.jpg" width="400">
</div>

* We use whose mostly for people:
  * A widow is a woman whose husband is dead. (her husband is dead)
  * What's the name of the man whose car you borrowed? (you borrowed his car)
  * I met someone whose brother I went to school with. (I went to school with his/her brother)
* Compare who and whose
  * I met a man who knows you. (he knows you)
  * I met a man whose sister knows you. (his sister knows you)
---
* Whom
* Whom is possible instead of who when it is the object of the verb in the relative clause
  * George is a person whom I admire very much. (I admire him)
* You can also use whom with a preposition (to whom I from whom I with whom etc.):
  * I like the people with whom I work. (I work with them)
---
* Where
* You can use where in a relative clause to talk about a place:

<div align=center>
<img src="../_images/life/english_relative_clauses_example8.jpg" width="400">
</div>

  * I recently went back to the town where I grew up. (or ... the town I grew up in or .. . the town that Igrew up in)
  * I would like to live in a place where there is plenty of sunshine

### Releative clauses 4: extra information clauses (1)
* In both types of relative clause we use who for people and which for things. But:
  * Type 1 -> You can use that:
    * Do you know anyone who/that speaks French and Italian?
  * Type2 -> You cannot use that:
    * John, who (not that) speaks French and Italian, works as a tour guide

  * You can leave out who/which/that when it is the object 
    * We stayed at the hotel (that/which) you recommended
  * You cannot leave out who or which:
    * We stayed at the Park Hotel, which a friend of ours recommended.

### Releative clauses 5: extra information clauses (2)
* Which (not what)
* Study this example:
  * Joe got the job. This surprised everybody. (2 sentences)
  * Joe got the job, which surprised everybody. (1 sentence)
* In this example, which = 'the fact that he got the job'. You must use which (not what) in sentences like these:
  * Sarah couldn't meet us, which was a shame. (not what was a shame)

### **-ing** and **-ed** clauses (the woman **talking to Tom** the boy **injured in the accident** ) 
* A clause is a part of a sentence. Some clauses begin with -ing or -ed. For example:
  * Do you know the woman `[talking to Tom]{-ing clause}`
  * The boy `[injured in the accident]{-ed clause}` was taken to hospital.
* We use -ing clauses to say what somebody (or something) is (or was) doing at a particular time:
  * Do you know the woman talking to Tom? (the woman is talking to Tom)

  
## (98~112) Adjectives and adverbs

### Adjectives ending in **-ing** and **-ed** (**boring/bored** etc.) 
* Many adjectives end in -ing and -ed, for example: boring and bored. Study this example situation:
* Jane has been doing the same job for a very long time. Every day she does exactly the same thing again and again. She doesn't enjoy her job any more and would like to do something different.
  * Jane's job is boring.
  * Jane is bored (with her job).
* Somebody is bored if something (or somebody else) is boring. Or, if something is boring, it makes you bored. So:
  * jane is bored because her job is boring.
  * jane's job is boring, so jane is bored. (not jane is boring)
* If a person is boring, this means that they make other people bored:
  * George always talks about the same things. He's really boring.

### Adjectives: a **nice new** house, you look **tired**
* Sometimes we use two or more adjectives together
  * My brother lives in a nice new house
  * In the kitchen there was a beautiful large round wooden table
* Adjectives like new/large/round/wooden are fact adjectives. They give us factual information about age, size, colour etc.
* Adjectives like nice/beautiful are opinion adjectives. They tell us what somebody thinks of something or somebody.
* Opinion adjectives usually go before fact adjectives.

| | opinion | fact | |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| a |  **nice**  | **long** | summer holiday |
| an |  **interesting**  | **young** | man |
|  |  **delicious**  | **hot** | vegetable soup |
| a |  **beautiful**  | **large round wooden** | table |
---
* We use adjectives after be/get/become/seem:
  * `Be careful!`
  * `I'm tired` and `I'm getting hungry`.
  * As the film went on, it `became` more and more `boring`
  * Your friend `seems` very `nice`.

### Adjectives and adverbs 1 (**quick/quickly**)
* Look at these examples:
  * Our holiday was too short- the time passed very quickly.
  * Two people were seriously injured in the accident.
* `Quickly` and `seriously` are adverbs. Many adverbs are formed from an adjective+ `-ly`:
  * adjective: `quick` `senous` `bad` `careful` `quiet` `heavy`
  * adverb: `quickly` `seriously` `badly` `carefully` `quietly` `heavily`
* Not all words ending in `-ly` are adverbs. Some adjectives end in `-ly` too, for example:
  * friendly Lively elderly Lonely silly Lovely
---
* Adjective or adverb?
  * Adjectives (quick/careful etc.) tell us about a noun (somebody or something). We use adjectives before nouns:
    * Sam is a careful driver. (not a carefully driver)
    * We didn't go out because of the heavy rain
  * Adverbs (quickly/carefully etc.) tell us about a verb (how somebody does something or how something happens):
    * Sam drove carefully along the narrow road. (not drove careful)
    * We didn't go out because it was raining heavily. (not raining heavy)
* Compare:
  * She speaks `perfect` English
  * She speaks English `perfectly`
* We also use adjectives after some verbs, especially be, and also Look/feel/sound etc.
* Compare:
  * e.g.
    * Please `be quiet`
    * I was disappointed that my exam results `were` so `bad`
    * Why do you always `look` so `serious`?
    * I `feel happy`
  * e.g.
    * Please `speak quietly`.
    * I was unhappy that I `did` so `badly` in the exam. (not did so bad)
    * Why do you never `take` me `seriously`?
    * The children were `playing happily`

### Adjectives and adverbs 2 (**well/fast/late, hard/hardly**)
* Good/Well
* Good is an adjective. The adverb is well
  * Your English is good. but Your speak English well.
  * Susan is a good pianist. but Susan plays the piano well.

### **So** and **such**
* Compare so and such:
* We use so + adjective/adverb:
  * so stupid, so quick, so nice, so quickly
  * I didn't like the book. The story was so stupid
* We use such + noun:
  * such a story, such people
* We also use such +adjective +noun:
  * such a stupid story, such nice people
  * I didn't like the book. lt was such a stupid story. (not a so stupid story)
* We say such a ... (not a such):
  * such a big dog (not a such big dog)

### **Enough** and **too**
* Enough goes after adjectives and adverbs: 
  * I can't run very far. I'm not fit enough. (not enough fit)
  * Let's go. We've waited Long enough.
  * I can let you know tomorrow. Is that soon enough?
* Compare too ... and not ... enough:
  * You never stop working. You work too hard. (=more than is necessary)
  * You're lazy. You don't work hard enough. (=less than is necessary)

### **Quite, pretty, rather** and **fairly**
* You can use quite/pretty/rather/fairly + adjectives or adverbs. So you can say:
  * lt's quite cold. lt's pretty cold. lt's rather cold. lt's fairly cold.
* Quite/pretty/rather/fairly = less than 'very' but more than 'a little'.
---
* Quite and pretty are similar in meaning:
  * I'm surprised you haven't heard of her. She's quite famous I pretty famous. (=less than 'very famous', but more than 'a little famous')
* Pretty is an informal word and is used mainly in spoken English.
* Quite goes before a/an:
  * We live in quite an old house. (not a quite old house)
* Compare:
  * Sarah has quite a good job.
  * Sarah has a pretty good job.

### Comparison 1 (**cheaper, more expensive** etc.)

## (113~120) Conjunctions and prepositions
  * Although I though I even though In spite of I despite 

## (121~136) Prepositions
  * At/on/in (time)  

## (137~145) Phrasal verbs
  * Phrasal verbs 1 General points 

## Compare:
* Present continuous and present simple(I am doing and I do)
  * Present continuous (I am doing)We use the continuous for things happening ator around the time of speaking.The action is not complete. 
  * Present simple (I do)We use the simple for things in general orthings that happen repeatedly. 
  * We use continuous forms for actions and happenings that have started but not finished (they areeating I it is raining etc.). Some verbs (for example, know and Like) are not normally used in thisway. We don't say 'I am knowing' or 'they are liking'; we say 'I know', 'they Like'. 
* Present perfect continuous and simple (I have been doing and I have done)
* Present perfect and past 1 (I have done and I did)
  * The present perfect (something has happened) is a present tense. It always tells us about thesituation now. 'Tom has lost his key'= he doesn't have his key now (see Unit 7).The past simple (something happened) tells us only about the past. If somebody says 'Tom lost hiskey', this doesn't tell us whether he has the key now or not. It tells us only that he lost his key at sometime in the past. 
* Present perfect and past 2(I have done and I did)
  * Do not use the present perfect (I have done) when you talk about a finished time (for example,yesterday I ten minutes ago I in 2005 I when I was a child). Use a past tense: It was very cold yesterday. (not has been) Paul and Lucy arrived ten minutes ago. (not have arrived) Did you eat a lot of sweets when you were a child? (not have you eaten) I got home late last night. I was very tired and went straight to bed.
