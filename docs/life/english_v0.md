* Record the day I was late

  1. I remember when i was in elementary school, I was very late once,I usually got up at 7 in the morning,  run for half an hour after getting up, then took a shower and went to school after ate to breakfast.

  2. But on that moring,I didn't get up at 7 o'clock. It seems that because i slept too late the day before or because i forgot to set the alarm clock, i got up at 10 o'clock. I didn't have breakfast and running and i didn't take a shower, just put a little food to my school bag,then rushed to the school.

  3. Anyway, i was late for nearly a class, About half an hour,The head teacher was very angry when she saw me,she asked me to go to her office to explain the reason for being late, I was nervous and cried ,I said: when my parents went out,they accidentally locked the door,I couldn't get out,They didn't come back untill 10 o'clock, then i pretended to be aggrieved, the head teacher was finally no longer angry.

  4. 我记得在我上小学的时候，有一次非常严重的迟到，我通常是早上7点起床，起床后去跑步半个小时，接着洗个澡，然后去吃完早餐就出发去学校了。

     但是在那个早晨，我7点钟没有起来，好像是因为前一天睡的太晚了还是因为忘记定闹钟，我10点才起床，我没有吃早餐和跑步，也没有洗澡，只是装了一点食物在书包，然后冲向学校。

     不管怎样，我还是迟到了将近一节课的时间，大约半个多小时，班主任看到我的时候很生气，她让我去她的办公室去解释迟到的原因，当时我紧张坏了并且哭了起来，我就说：我爸妈出门的时候不小心锁了门，我出不去，直到10点他们才回来，然后我装作很委屈的样子，老师才终于不生气了

* **Uses of the verb have**

  ​	The verb ***have*** is used in a number of ways in English. It can be used as an auxiliary verb. It can also be used as an ordinary verb.

  Notes

  **Have** is used in the present tense when the subject is a plural noun or the pronouns *I / you / they / we.*

  **Has** is used in the present tense when the subject is a singular noun or pronoun.

  **Had** is used in the past tense with subjects of all  numbers and persons.

  **Have and Have Got**

  *Have got* means the same as have in most cases. It can also be used to indicate possession of objects and similar ideas.

  *Examples:*

  - She has got black hair.
  - I **have got s**even sisters.

  **Common expressions with have**

  The ordinary verb have is used in a number of common expressions.

  **Have as an Auxiliary Verb**

  As an auxiliary verb **have** is used in the formation of perfect tenses. Remember that the verb **have** will change its form depending on the number and person of the subject and the tense of the verb. Here is a quick review of the tenses that use have as an auxiliary verb.

* **过去式与过去分词**

  一、动词的过去式是一个动词，单独作谓语。不能与助动词、情态动词连用。它的词性与动词的第三人称单数一样。 动词的过去式可分为规则动词和不规则动词。

  二、动词的过去分词是动词的一种非谓语形式，也叫非限定性动词。不能独立作谓语，只能与助动词一起构成谓语。如:“have/has/had +过去分词”构成完成时态;“be+过去分词”构成被动语态等。它相当于一个形容词或副词，在句中起一个形容词或副词的作用，可作表语、定语、补语等。它的作用与现在分词doing类似。过去分词表的意义是被动或完成。

  三、不过，过去式和过去分词最主要的区别是:过去式是一个动词，而过去分词是一个动词的非谓语形式，相当于一个形容词或副词。
